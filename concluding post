Bountiful Greetings from Team AISA 😄✨
They say, time flies, and yes it does⌚ A few weeks ago, we were busy preparing for the event, and today it’s been a week since we concluded the event. 
     Your interest and our efforts have together made the International Data Science Symposium a grand success🤝🏻✨ We would like to extend our utmost gratitude to everyone who has an active contribution to the event. 
    It’s been a fantastic time and amazing things have been achieved. This event is finished, of course, but it doesn’t really stop here – and it’ll soon be time to be thinking about organizing the next one. 😄
Till then, stay home, and stay safe.
Keep learning, and keep growing!!

Thanks, and regards,
AISA, VIIT
